### Even machines dream: Feminist robots for Twitter
---


### Welcome :)

This is a bots workshop where we hope we'll make one (or many) feminist robot(s) for Twitter using generative grammar constructs.

### What is a bot?

A bot (robot apheresis) is a computer program that automatically performs repetitive tasks over the internet. Normally, these bots perform simple and structurally repetitive tasks. (Wikipedia)

When they act together, it's often called a bots farm. They are rarely influential, but they do help generate trending topics - the topics that Twitter considers "hot" at a certain moment and stands out on its platform - or generate "noise" about a topic. (Chequeado)
<br/><br/>


#### Bots x Trolls

A troll is someone focused on harassing, criticizing, or antagonizing in a provocative and derogatory manner. The word originally refers to unpleasant folk characters living in Scandinavian caverns. (Chequeado) 

A troll may be a bot, but a bot isn't always a troll.

### Uses and possibilities of robots for feminist internet: fun + fight

Here are some examples of feminist bots that were created with the material from this workshop. As we have never done in English before, they are all in Spanish. I've translated some to give you an idea, but their playful intent may be getting lost in translation.

"Widow, happy aggressive feminist"

"Botota says misbehave ;)"

"Botota says carpe diem"

"Good day to reinvent the platforms and business models of machitrolls in universities"

"Good day to spit out Bill Gates in the communities."

"Today can be a great day for a #feministinternet and to take a walk without the cyberpatriarchy in our parks"

### Our robots
Conceptually in this manual we will use generative grammar theory to create our bots. 


#### Generative grammar

[![N|Solid](https://media.giphy.com/media/qccVJBDT6xNqU/giphy.gif)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

Generative grammar is a linguistic theory that regards grammar as a system of rules that generates exactly those combinations of words that form grammatical sentences in a given language. Noam Chomsky first used the term in relation to the theoretical linguistics of grammar that he developed in the late 1950s. (Wikipedia)


<br/><br/><br/>

### Let's do it!
1. Robot concept: ideas? 
- What will be the '@'?
- Cover image
- Profile image
- Description 

2. [Create a Twitter account](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup)

3. (logged on Twitter) Access the website:: https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/
4. Click on "Sign in with Twitter"
5. Click on "Authorize the application"
6. If you reached the next page, you are ready to create the rules of yout bot. In the space after "JSON Tracery" is where we are going to write our code. 

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/RYLoszA.png)
<br/><br/>

7. Trying with an example is the best way to understand how it works and from there start creating your own robot. Paste the code that follows into the space and start playing:

~~~~ 
{
"origin": ["Good day for #action# #something# with #object# #where#"]
,"action": ["explode","leave","kill","?","?","?","?"]
,"something": ["Facebook","patriarchy","the machista","?","?","?"]
,"object": ["scissors","encryption","?","?","?","?","?"]
,"where": ["in the kitchen","in the car","?","?","?"]

}
~~~~
<br/><br/>
- **Origin" is where the structure of our sentence comes from.**
- **Everything that is between "#" in "origin" is what is going to get mixed up in the sentence**
<br/><br/>

8. With the code there by clicking on "refresh" you can look at the possibilities of combinations with the words we define in our example:

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/ZcVL3jc.png)

- If you click on "tweet" that text will be published in the Twitter account of your tweet.

- Where you see "Never" you can define how long your bot is going to say something on Twitter.
- In "Don't reply" you have the possibility to choose that the robot answers (Reply) or does not answer (Don't reply) when someone sends him a message on Twitter. If the choice is "Reply", she will answer with a combination of words with the same rule you already created. 
- In "Don't share" you can choose whether your theft code is available (Share) or not (Don't share) to the public on the Cheap bots done quick website.
9. With everything ready you just have to "SAVE" and you're going to have the active bot on the Twitter account you created for her.
